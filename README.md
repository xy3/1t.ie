# 1t.ie
Quick Short link generator. This began as a 3-day coding challenge but here we are I guess ðŸ¤·

Live at [1t.ie](https://1t.ie)

## Features

1t.ie provides easy link shortening without needing to sign in. 
Shortened links are as short as possible and GET request parameters will be forwarded
to the resolved URL.

In a nutshell:
- URL parameter forwarding
- Really short links
- No overhead; average 9ms URL resolution  
- No need to register
- Register to make links permanent
- Anonymous links expire after 1 week

\*Not all features added currently  


## Installing on your server

First set up an SQL database and import `setup.sql` to build the table structure.

Then, in a PHP / Apache web accessible directory run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xy3/1t-ui.git
cd 1t-ui
composer install
```
*Note that you need to clone the *1t-ui* repository, not this repository.

1t-ui needs to be the root directory of a virtual host.

Once finished, modify the values in config.ini with your actual database login details.

## Requirements

1. PHP > 5.4.0
2. Composer
3. PHP web server (e.g. Apache, NGINX)

## Todo
- My account page
